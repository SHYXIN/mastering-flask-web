Project Name: Doctor's Appointment Management Software (DAMS)
Author: Sherwin John C. Tragura
Description: This prototype is an API application necessary 
       to simulate and run DAGs using Airflow 2.x.

       The application uses the Blueprint and Application Factory design approach in managing its source codes and directories.
========================================================================

A. Project Directory

--- ch08-spiff-web (main project directory)
      --- modules  - contains all the  view modules and their respective components, 
                        such API endpoint functions, repository, and services
               - contains the __init__.py - the heart of the applications
                     - contains all the initialization, setups, and   
                          configurations
                     - creates the Flask instance and returns it to main.py
              
      --- files - the folder contains sample data for the DAG
      --- main.py -  the main module that imports the create_app() from 
          modules/__init__.py


B. Configuration files 
    --- config_dev.toml - configuration variables written in TOML for development stage
    
     
C. Database Configurations
   db_dump - contains the dams.sql dump file, which contains dummy test data
           - database platform is PostgreSQL 

D. Dependencies
   --- Create a Python virtual env (e.g., ch08-spiff-env) using the venv module first before running the dependency file.
   --- requirements.txt - contains the updated modules just run it inside your venv directory using:
                  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

E. Running the application:
   --- Run first the Airflow 2.x server
   --- Be sure to follow the instructions in Chapter 8 for the deployment of DAGs
   --- Run the command python main.py inside the enabled ch08-spiff-env.
