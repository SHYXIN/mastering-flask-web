Project Name: Online Complaint Management System (OCMS)
Author: Sherwin John C. Tragura
Description: This prototype is an API-based version of the complaint system that 
    attempts to apply caching and session handling to Flask's class-based views.

    This project uses the Blueprint approach in managing the project directories.
========================================================================

A. Project Directory

--- ch04-api (main project directory)
      --- modules  - contains all the Blueprint modules and their respective components, 
                        such API endpoint functions, repository, and services
               - contains the forms directory that contains Flask-WTF form models for web forms 
      
      --- flask_session - contains Flask-Session session files
      --- model - contains model classes and database configurations
     
B. Configuration files 
    --- config_dev.toml - configuration variables written in TOML for development stage
    
C. Dependencies
   --- Create a Python virtual env (e.g., ch04-env) using the venv module first before running the dependency files
   --- requirements.txt - contains the updated modules just run it inside your venv directory using:
                  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

D. Running the application:
   --- Generate first the PostgreSQL table schema using the following Flask-Migrate commands:
         1. python -m flask --app manage.py db init
         2. python -m flask --app manage.py db migrate -m "Initial migration."
         3. python -m flask --app manage.py db upgrade
            python -m flask --app manage.py db downgrade (if schema needs update but modify the run_migrations_****() in env.py if necessary)

   --- Run the command python main.py inside the enabled ch04-env.
