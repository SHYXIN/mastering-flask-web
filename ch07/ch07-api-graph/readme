========================================================================

A. Project Directory
--- ch07-api-graph (main project directory)
      --- modules - contains all the API modules and their respective components
                    that use Neo4J graph database 
               - contains the repository directory for each NoSQL database platform
              
      --- main.py - creates the Flask instance and imports the API endpoints 
                    using its context
   

B. Configuration files 
    --- config_dev.toml - configuration variables written in TOML for development stage
    --- neo4j_config.py - provides the Neo4J connectivity
    
C. Database Configurations
   --- Use and install and use Neo4j Desktop Community version

D. Dependencies
   --- Create a Python virtual env (e.g., ch07-env) using the venv module first before running the dependency files
   --- requirements.txt - contains the updated modules just run it inside your venv directory using:
                  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

E. Running the application:
   --- Start the Neo4J server first
   --- Follow the instructions in Chapter 7 in creating the graph database
   --- Run the command python main.py inside the enabled ch07-env
